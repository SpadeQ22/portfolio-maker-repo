### Hi there, It's Omar Ashraf👋
### and contributor: Hussein Selim 👋

## We are currently Engineering Students at Ain Shams University in Egypt!!

- 🔭 I can work with all languages (python, c++, c, java, etc...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other software developers
- 🥅 2020 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects

I developed this software to fix the hard time students have, just to make their Portfolio for each subject
including all (assignments, quizzes, etc...). And came up with the portfolio-maker software; which takes care of you 
and does everything from downloading your files automatically from the LMS to creating your full portfolio with your 
templates and documents all filled and ready to deliver with just a few clicks !
